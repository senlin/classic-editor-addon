The "Classic Editor +" plugin disables the block editor, removes enqueued scripts/styles and brings back classic Widgets.

== Description ==

> GDPR-compliant: does not collect any user data

The free "Classic Editor +" plugin is targeted at everyone who does not want to use the WP Block Editor (Gutenberg), introduced in WordPress 5.0. Install it now on sites and the UX remains the same as you are used to without redundant styling being added to the frontend of your site!

<strong>What's New:</strong>
Removes further blocks related CSS from Woocommerce (if active)

This plugin simply disables the WP Block Editor, removes any and all styling from both front- and backend and disables the block editor for widgets too.

And if WooCommerce has been installed on the site, "Classic Editor +" removes the block styles of that plugin too.

There are no Settings, it simply does what it says on the label.

Therefore I highly recommend installing this "Classic Editor +" plugin.

I support this plugin exclusively through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/classic-editor-addon/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue here. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.

Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the WP block editor? =

The release of WordPress 5.0 came with a replacement of the TinyMCE editor you had gotten used to for adding or editing content. Some find it an improvement, others don't. More information can be found on the [WP 5.0 release post](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/).

= Why this plugin? Isn't the purpose of the Classic Editor plugin to disable the new block editor? =

The Classic Editor plugin does not remove any of the frontend styling, even when one selects the option to disable the block editor. In terms of site optimisation that is not good practice.
This "Classic Editor +" simply removes the block editor and all its styling from both frontend and backend and if your site uses WooCommerce, it also removes block styling related to that from the frontend.

= Do I still need the Classic Editor plugin on my site?  =

Version 4.0 of the "Classic Editor +" plugin has been a complete rewrite (and simplification) and it is no longer depending on the Classic Editor plugin. When the latter is active, it will be deactivated and then you can safely remove it.

= I have an issue with this plugin, where can I get support? =
